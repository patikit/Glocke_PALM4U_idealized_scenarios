# Glocke_PALM4U_idealized_scenarios
To study the coupling between atmospheric and subsurface energy fluxes, we provide different scenarios for an idealized domain in the turbulence and building resolving large eddy simulation urban climate model PALM-4U 23.10. 
The p3d file contains all scenarios we tested in our study. Using them, the seasonality (winter/summer) has to be selected properly, as well as the boundary conditions, the vegetation_type, moisture etc. See herefore the comments.
The static file has to be changed dependig on the land cover (bare soil, tall grass, short grass).
